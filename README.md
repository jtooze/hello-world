Hello World

My name is Joseph Tooze. I am just reintroducing the world of github to myself. I did dabble a bit taking a course on application development, but I stepped away from it for a while because I was learning other things. I am now serious about my project development and want to take it a step further using github. I have a project I worked on last term that I would like to use as my first project.
